# Andrew McMillan

ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a full-stack web developer from Victoria, BC!

## Education :school:

* Diploma in Full-Stack Web Development from Concordia University | 2022
* Computer Science at University of Victoria | 2021-2022
* Bachelor of Sport and Fitness Leadership at Camosun College | 2013-2017

## Current Project 	:hammer_and_wrench:

I developed an eCommerce site called [CDI Furlers](https://cdifurlers.com/) that sells sailing accessories. Users can add, remove, and edit their carts, make purchases, and search for the correct accessory based on their boat model and make.

I also developed an eCommerce site called [Inflatable Boat World](https://inflatableboatworld.com/) that sells dinghies and accessories of all makes and models. Users can add, remove, and edit their carts, make purchases, and search for their desired products.

One of my current projects is [Slam Dunk Movies](https://www.slamdunkmovies.com/), a NextJs app that features news and articles about movies, comic books, and TV shows. The articles are generated by Microsoftâ€™s Bing Chat, a chat mode of Bing. I manually create prompts for Bing Chat and add the articles (and any images) to the app directory. My goal is to automate this process when Bing Chat has a public API and use a database to store the data.
