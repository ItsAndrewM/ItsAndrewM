## Current Project 	üõ†Ô∏è

I'm always maintaining and developing [Precision Sail Loft](https://www.precisionsailloft.com/), an eccommerce site focused on sailing accessories as well as sail quoting and education.

I developed an headless eCommerce site in React and Wordpress/Woocommerce, called [CDI Furlers](https://cdifurlers.com/) that sells furlers and sailing accessories. Users can add, remove, and edit their carts, make purchases, and search for the correct accessory based on their boat model and make.

I also developed an eCommerce site, in Wordpress, called [Inflatable Boat World](https://inflatableboatworld.com/) that sells dinghies and accessories of all makes and models. Users can add, remove, and edit their carts, make purchases, and search for their desired products.

I also developed [Slam Dunk Movies](https://www.slamdunkmovies.com/), a NextJs app that features news and articles about movies, comic books, and TV shows. The articles are generated by Microsoft‚Äôs Bing Chat, a chat mode of Bing. I manually create prompts for Bing Chat and add the articles (and any images) to the app directory. My goal is to automate this process when Bing Chat has a public API and use a database to store the data.

I recently launched [McMillan Farms](https://mcmillanfarms.ca) and [Shop - McMillan Farms](https://shop.mcmillanfarms.ca), two sites for my families business. McMillan Farms is a seasonal, agrotourism farm and the sites are focused on educating, selling tickets and merchandise.  Both are developed using NextJs and [Shop - McMillan Farms](https://shop.mcmillanfarms.ca) is a headless site with a Swell.is backend.

I developed a headless ecommerce site using Swell.is, Builder.io and NextJs called [Precision Cruising Accessories](https://www.precisioncruisingaccessories.com/).  This site is a high product eccommerce site selling a variety of sailing and boating products.  I also developed a custom checkout process utilizing Paypal SDK and Swell's extensive API's.
